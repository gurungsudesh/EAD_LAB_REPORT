# **Objective 1: Simple Task to understand Java**

This objective was just a revision of java so that this concept of java could help in upcoming lab. A simple task class was created consisting of two methods and creating the object of the class those methods were called and used.

# **Objective 2: Factory Pattern Design Implementation**
# **Theory :**

In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.

# **Objective 3: Singleton Pattern**

# **Theory :**
Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.Singleton pattern can be an Early initialization and lazy initialication.In early initialization, the instance of Singleton Class is created at the time of class loading, this is the easiest method to create a singleton class but it has a drawback that instance is created even though client application might not be using it.But lazy initialization method to implement Singleton pattern creates the instance in the global access method. Here is the sample code for creating Singleton class with this approach.

# **Objective 4: Abstract Class Concept**
# **Theory :**

A class that is declared using “abstract” keyword is known as abstract class. It can have abstract methods(methods without body) as well as concrete methods (regular methods with body). A normal class(non-abstract class) cannot have abstract methods. In this guide we will learn what is a abstract class, why we use it and what are the rules that we must remember while working with it in Java.An abstract class can not be instantiated, which means you are not allowed to create an object of it. Why? We will discuss that later in this guide.
